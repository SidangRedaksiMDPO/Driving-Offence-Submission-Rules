Rules of Submission For Submitting Driving Offences

1. Plate number must be visible.

2. Location must be precise, using Google Maps is recommended.

3. Date/Time is required.

4. Either front, back or front + back footage is accepted. But those with front + back dashcam, both footages are recommended.

5. Videos of any official/authority/emergency vehicles (for example: PDRM/Bomba/Military/Ambulance/YBs/Diplomats including but not limited to, vehicles made known to us as VVIPs are not accepted. We assume they are engaged in official/emergency duties, thus driving their vehicles in such manner. Let the relevant authorities deal with their own department.

6. Videos taken at any or near religious centres such as mosques, temples, churches and the equivalent, are rejected.

7. Any video that are taken by cammer, but cammer also breaking the road rules as well as the driving offender, will be rejected.

8. For fairness, we would require at least 10 secs (maximum 1 minute) before and after incident so that we would like to know what actually happened/transpired before and after the incident. For example, if the road offence incident segment lasts 20 seconds, we would require a minimum of 50 secs (10 secs before + 20 sec during + 10 sec after) and a maximum of 2 minutes and 20 seconds of the video (1 minute before + 20 sec during + 1 minute after). If you don't understand, please PM our page, we can help.

9. With regards to point 7, any submissions which are assumed taken by driver (a.k.a. driver's point of view) by using handphone will be rejected. However, submissions taken by passenger (a.k.a. passenger's point of view) are accepted. We have team of professional videographers who can able to distinguish whether it was taken by passenger or a driver, so do be honest.

10. Before submitting, ask yourself these questions.

    Are you driving according to road rules during the incident?
    Do you practice driving defensively on the road in accordance with road rules?

If you know the answers to the above, you are good to go.

11. Shoot at your own risk. Shoot safe. Be safe. Our page will not be liable for any injuries / deaths that may have caused you in any way during your photo/video takings. If you ever felt threaten in any way during the photoshoots/videoshoots, police is just a dial away.
